# AIRLINE-RESERVATION-SYSTEM-using-Java
This web-based Java project helps you in searching from pick-up location to destination, and filters out the flight details with timing, and available seats. It consolidates data from all airlines using globally distributed systems. After entering all the required details of the customer, it asks you to choose a flight with a preferred time slot, complete the payment, and book the ticket.
